Hey there. Thanks for checking out my little bit of hackery. 

Nextris is a Tetris spinoff with procedural graphics and audio.  In other words, there are no sprites, and there are no soundbites.  Everything's done on the fly!

By default, movement uses WASD and rotation uses the L and P keys (this was developed on a laptop, can you tell?). You can change this by hitting Return/Enter during play and following the instructions in the console, or alternatively editing keyconfig.txt and substituting the appropriate ASCII values. Have fun!
