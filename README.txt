Nextris is a Tetris spinoff with procedural graphics. By default, movement 
uses WASD and rotation uses the L and P keys (this was developed on a laptop, 
can you tell?). You can change this by hitting Return/Enter during play and 
following the instructions in the console, or alternatively editing 
keyconfig.txt and substituting the appropriate ASCII values. Have fun!
